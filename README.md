## Skills level

* **Beginner** As a beginner, you can perform basic tasks and have a preliminary understanding of the skill. Still, you cannot handle complicated aspects or troubleshoot problems. Typically, if you only have a novice understanding of a skill, itâ€™s best to leave it off of your resume completely.
* **Intermediate** Generally speaking, you should only list a skill if you have at least an intermediate-level proficiency. This level of expertise indicates that you can handle a variety of uncomplicated tasks and situations. At an intermediate level, you may know some tricks and troubleshoot basic issues. Still, you likely have to rely on resources to complete certain functions.
* **Proficient** Someone who is proficient and can handle most tasks independently. They have advanced knowledge of the skill and its functions and can troubleshoot problems on their own.
* **Expert** Someone who is an expert has intimate knowledge of every aspect of the skill, its features, and any issues. If others often come to you for help and guidance, this is a good indicator that you are an expert.
